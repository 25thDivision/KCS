Heavy-Hex Surface Code (3,3) -- v6: depth-optimized (paper Fig 1b scheme)
=========================================================================
Same 37-qubit patch and 16 stabilizers as v5. Implements the Benito/Vezvaee
shared-fold protocol:

  Abstract fold (Benito Eq. 1): one CX(outer->rep) per shared pair folds
  Z-info onto rep AND X-info onto outer simultaneously. Rung ancillas then
  measure the weight-2 remnants directly (Z: CX(rep->anc); X: anc-as-control).

  Heavy-hex mediation: each abstract CX is a 2-CX parity fold through the
  bridge (CX(outer->br), CX(br->rep)); the unfold is the exact 2-CX inverse.
  Bridges are never measured or reset; ancillas are never reset (XOR chains).
  X-check outcomes correspond to persistent JOINT operators (data (x) bridge);
  all joints mutually commute, so cycle-to-cycle differences are deterministic.
  Effective in-run X-check data support is the rung pair; full abstract
  support is recovered by final-readout detectors. For memory-Z experiments
  the protection of Z_L rests on the Z-checks, whose joints carry the FULL
  abstract support, so d_z = 3 is preserved in-run.

Round structure (all folds within a round are disjoint -> single CX layer):
  R1 checks: X37 Z56 X77 Z96 | Z57 X78 | X76 Z97
  R1 folds : (45>44>43) (65>64>63) (85>84>83) (105>104>103) (69>68>67) (89>88>87)
  R2 checks: Z37 X57 Z77 X97 | X56 Z76 X96 | Z78
  R2 folds : (47>46>45) (67>66>65) (87>86>85) (107>106>105) (63>62>61) (83>82>81)

Bridges used: R1 {44,64,84,104,68,88}, R2 {46,66,86,106,62,82} -- disjoint.
